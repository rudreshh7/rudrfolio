## What's the Vibe of Flexbox?

At its core, **Flexbox** is about laying things out _in a row or column_. That’s it. It gives you control over spacing, alignment, and flow — without writing JavaScript hacks or ten utility classes you barely remember.

- The **children** become flex items that behave like respectful tenants. They listen. They align. They adapt.

Here’s the starter pack:

```css
.parent {
  display: flex;
}
```
